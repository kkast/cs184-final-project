<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>In this project i have implemented a way to get the control points of Bezier curves from .ttf files</p>

<h2 align="middle">TTF parsing</h2>


<p>The initial idea was to be able to edit and save .ttf files in the program.
    for this purpose i looked at multiple libraries in js and puython. in js Opentype is convenient to convert ttf into its own format, but it doesnt represent .ttf</p>
<p>I have donwloaded file example.ttf as an example. in the main.py file using the python library fonttools i converted ttf file into xml. After that i have read the article how to deal
with control points described in xml. https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TrueType-Reference-Manual/RM01/Chap1.html#necessary it says that two offline curves one after another mean that
bezier control point between is in the middle of these 2 points. Using this information i write parseXml.py file that takes the xml file, extracts the counters for requested chracter and parses the coordinates in order to get all the points on the curve.</p>
<p>If i was able to finish the project i would build the grid and the render each of the lines received from points from the previous step. If we have two on-curve points one after another, that would mean that they form a line, else 3 points, one in the middle is off-curve point, they
form quadratic Bezier curve. Using the algebraic formula for the quadratic Bezier curve, or formaula for a line, i would step from one point to another on the curve and then check which pixel this sample belongs,
if it belongs to some pixel we try to render, we color that pixel into black, else we go to the next step. </p>
<p>This algorithms would give us the way to render the borders of the fonts.</p>
